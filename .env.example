# =============================================================================
# PocketBase Configuration
# =============================================================================
# By default, the app connects to the Railway-hosted PocketBase instance:
# https://rede-campus.up.railway.app
#
# This URL is hardcoded in the app for consistency across all environments.
# Set POCKETBASE_URL only if you need to override it for server-side requests.
#
# Examples:
#   - Use Railway backend (default): No configuration needed
#   - Use local PocketBase (server-side only): POCKETBASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8090
#
# POCKETBASE_URL=https://rede-campus.up.railway.app
