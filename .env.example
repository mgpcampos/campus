# PocketBase Configuration
# 
# In production (Docker), the browser uses same-origin since Caddy proxies /api/* to PocketBase.
# The server uses INTERNAL_POCKETBASE_URL for direct communication with PocketBase.
#
# INTERNAL_POCKETBASE_URL is only needed in production and defaults to http://127.0.0.1:8090
# when running in Docker (both PocketBase and SvelteKit in the same container).
#
# For local development, you can set PUBLIC_POCKETBASE_URL to override the browser URL.
# This is useful when running PocketBase separately from the SvelteKit dev server.
#
# Examples:
#   - Local development (separate PocketBase): PUBLIC_POCKETBASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8090
#   - Docker (same container): No config needed, uses same-origin + internal localhost
#   - Production (separate services): INTERNAL_POCKETBASE_URL=http://pocketbase:8090
INTERNAL_POCKETBASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8090
